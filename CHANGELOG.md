The Self-Aware Release Update

🚀 **GITSHIP SELF-HEALING UPDATE**

This version introduces smart state detection to handle the "messy" parts of releasing. GitShip now acts as a detective to ensure your tags, GitHub releases, and PyPI packages stay in perfect sync.

* **Workflow Monitoring:** Real-time tracking of `publish.yml` via `gh` to prevent double-publishes or race conditions.
* **PyPI Verification:** Automatically checks the PyPI JSON API to verify if a deployment actually succeeded.
* **Draft Release Support:** Found a draft? GitShip can now promote it to full release or edit it in-place.
* **Tag Synchronization:** Detects when tags exist locally but are missing on the remote origin and offers an instant fix.

* **Smart Recovery Menu:** A new interactive CLI menu triggers when a partial release is detected, allowing for surgical "Reset" or "Resume" actions.
* **Changelog Optimization:** Refactored history lookups to be faster by avoiding root-commit overhead on large repositories.

Hotfix: PyPI Workflow Secrets & Staged File Visibility

This release critically repairs the `publish.yml` generation logic that caused workflow validation errors in v0.3.2, and fixes core issues with how staged files are detected.

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes
*   **GitHub Actions Workflow:** Fixed `Unrecognized named-value: 'secrets'` error. The generated `publish.yml` no longer attempts to access `secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN` inside `if:` conditions (where the secrets context is unavailable). It now relies on step-level logic to handle OIDC fallbacks safely.
*   **Staged File Visibility:** Fixed a logic error in `commit.py` where files staged with `git add` (Status `A ` or `M `) were invisible to the diff engine.
*   **License Detection:** Fixed "Unknown" license detection for packages like `yt-dlp` and `Flask`. The scanner now checks `pip` metadata fields before attempting to scrape files.

## 🛠 Improvements
*   **First Release Support:** Fixed an issue where generating release notes for a repository with *zero* previous tags would result in an empty diff (now correctly resolves the root commit).
*   **Commit Categorization:** Fixed a bug where files in `other/` or `tests/` categories were excluded from the detailed commit breakdown.
*   **File Type Detection:** Files without extensions (like `LICENSE` or `Makefile`) are now correctly categorized instead of falling into "Other".

Fix comment stripping in release notes

- **Comment stripping in release notes editor**
  Previously, only lines starting with `# ` (hash + space) were stripped as comments, while lines starting with just `#` (like the example comments in the template) were not. This caused template examples to potentially appear in final release notes. Now any line starting with `#` is properly stripped, with markdown headings (`## ...`) preserved.

- This is a one-character fix (`"# "` → `"#"`) that makes gitship's release note generator correctly strip its own example comments. Gitship, healing itself. ✨

## [0.3.1] — 2026-02-17

Atomic Translation Snapshots & Conflict-Safe Commits

This release makes gitship **ship itself** — the tool now has a new atomic commit flow for translations that:

- **Freezes exactly what you reviewed** — captures a snapshot of .po/.mo diffs vs HEAD the moment you enter review mode
- **Shows frozen preview** — large patches auto-preview first 50 lines per file (or full if small), with export to ~/gitship_exports/
- **Safely commits the snapshot** — stashes AI's latest work, writes the reviewed snapshot, stages/commits, then pops stash to restore AI progress
- **Auto-resolves binary conflicts** — .mo files never 3-way merge cleanly; now detects binaries via git diff --numstat and takes --theirs (AI's latest) automatically
- **Adds description/body input** — inline typing or editor for meaningful commit context (bullets, closes issues, etc.)

All this means gitship can now **commit its own translation changes** (or any ignored files) while an AI keeps modifying them in the background — without conflicts or losing live work.

**Meta moment**: This very release was committed using the new flow — gitship shipped itself!

Other tweaks:
- commit.py: new commit_translations_only() + review loop with snapshot locking
- gitops.py: capture_file_snapshot(), atomic_commit_with_snapshot(), stash pop binary resolver
- licenses.py: better transitive dep resolution (requirements.txt first)
- release.py: cleaned editor template

Ready for real-world translation workflows — massive Arabic surge (95%+) was committed cleanly with this!

## [0.3.0] — 2026-02-15

The "Atomic Workflow" Update - Interactive Operations & AI-Ready Foundation

## 🚀 Major Feature Release: The "Atomic Workflow" Engine

This release transforms Gitship from a collection of scripts into a robust Git orchestration platform with intelligent automation and safety guarantees.

### 🌟 Key Highlights

**Atomic GitOps Engine:** All operations now use a safety layer that automatically stashes and restores ignorable files (translations, configs, build artifacts) to prevent "dirty tree" errors during context switches.

**Interactive Commit & Release Builders:** Both workflows now feature 3-step interactive builders:
- Conventional commit type selection (feat/fix/docs/etc)
- Custom title with smart suggestions
- Editor for detailed notes with auto-generated breakdown appended
- Full markdown support with preserved headers

**Pre-Release Review:** Before generating changelogs, see a full commit review with descriptions and statistics - helps write better release notes and prevents blind releases.

**PyPI Version Sync:** Release workflow now compares against PyPI's latest version (not just local git tags) to ensure accurate changelog ranges.

### 🛠 New Features

**License Compliance Manager:**
- Auto-fetch dependency licenses from PyPI with GitHub fallback
- Generate `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` and `MANIFEST.in`
- Auto-sync `[tool.setuptools]` license-files in `pyproject.toml`
- Selective optional dependency group fetching
- Project license generator (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-3-Clause, AGPL-3.0)

**Interactive Merge Suite:**
- Guided conflict resolution with state caching
- Pause and resume complex merges without losing progress
- Semantic merge messages with categorized file statistics

**Documentation Tools:**
- Interactive README.md section editor (parse, edit, reorder, remove)
- Safe editing with automatic `.bak` creation
- Programmatic `.gitignore` management

**Smart Sync Command:**
- Unified `gitship sync`: Pull (rebase) + Push + Stale remote pruning in one flow
- Atomic operations prevent translation file conflicts

### 📈 Improvements

- Condensed diff exports with `--unified=1` (up to 70% smaller files)
- Semantic commit/merge messages with detailed file categorization
- Dependency scanner with project-specific ignore lists
- Branch management with redundant branch detection & bulk cleanup

### 🔧 New Commands

- `gitship merge` / `resolve` - Interactive merge and conflict resolution
- `gitship sync` - Unified sync workflow
- `gitship licenses` - Fetch and manage dependency licenses
- `gitship ignore` - Programmatic `.gitignore` management
- `gitship docs --edit` - Interactive documentation editor

### 🎯 Foundation for AI Integration

This release establishes the groundwork for AI-assisted workflows:
- Structured commit/review data for LLM consumption
- Non-interactive mode scaffolding for automation
- JSON-ready outputs for AI processing

## [0.2.0] — 2026-02-14

First public release – gitship is now live on GitHub and (soon) PyPI!

gitship is the interactive Git workflow tool that turns version control from frustrating archaeology into a guided, intelligent, and frustration-free experience.

- **Intelligent rename detection** — finds renames by content similarity *before* staging (smarter than git's default)

- **Semantic change grouping** — auto-categorizes files (code / tests / docs / config / other) for better understanding

- **Guided commit flows** — interactive review, smart message suggestions, one-command commit preparation

- **Atomic release recovery** — detects incomplete tags/releases (tag exists but code not committed), offers safe rollback + re-tag

- **Secure PyPI publishing setup** — auto-generates OIDC workflow, guides trusted publisher config, no API tokens needed

- **Identity-verified push** — prevents pushing as wrong user

- **Self-dogfooding milestone** — this release was created, recovered, tagged, and prepared for PyPI **using gitship itself**

- Added full release lifecycle automation (bump → changelog → tag → push → publish prep)

- Implemented atomic stash/pop for safe background operations (e.g. pull/rebase during release)

- Introduced proactive state checks (tag vs commit mismatch detection)

- Built-in PyPI first-release guidance + workflow generation

```bash

pip install gitship

pipx install gitship

```

What git should have been: **guided, frustration-free, and powerful**._
